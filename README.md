# Python-Challenge
Python challenge hosts the results for the following (2) activities which are part of Assignment #3; PyBank and PyPoll

The Python-Challenge is design to analyze (2) large data sets, individual in nature, but common in the pupose to assess python knowledge; PyBank and PyPoll.

PyBank exercises a code that analyzes the the financial records of a company. The dataset is composed of two columns: "Date" and "Profit/Losses" in csv format. The challenge requires generating a script that outputs the following information:
* The total number of months included in the dataset
* The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
* The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes
* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
* The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
The dataset can be found in the associated Resource folder, and the results are captured through the script in a text file labelled Bank_Results, in the associated Analysis folder.

PyPoll exercises a code that analyzes the vote counting process in a small, rural town. The dataset is composed of three columns: "Voter ID", "County", and "Candidate" in csv format.
The challenge requires generating a script that outputs the following information:
* The total number of votes cast
* A complete list of candidates who received votes
* The percentage of votes each candidate won
* The total number of votes each candidate won
* The winner of the election based on popular vote.
The dataset can be found in the associated Resource folder, and the results are captured through the script in a text file labelled Election_Results, in the associated Analysis folder.
